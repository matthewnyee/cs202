#include "store.h"
using namespace collection;

//These are the functions you will be implementing for Lab #2
//REMEMBER to use initialization lists for your constructors
//where they are appropriate

//Step 6a - implement the default constructor
binary_tree::binary_tree()
{


}

//Step 6b - impelment the BST default constructor
//BST constructor
BST::BST()
{


}

//Step 6c - impelment the store default constructor
//Think about what this should do
store::store()
{


}


//Step 7 - Now work on the copy constructor
/*
//Place your binary_tree copy constructor here. Make this a
//wrapper function, calling the recursive copy function below
//
//You should have already placed the prototype for this function
//in the .h file (that was NOT done for you already!)
//Use CARE when deciding the SYNTAX for the copy constructor!
//
//YOU WILL NEED TO "uncomment out" THIS CODE ONCE THIS 
//FUNCTION IS WRITTEN!
binary_tree::binary_tree(           )
{



} */

//Step 8 - Now implement the recursion part of the copy operation
//
//Recursive copy function
void binary_tree::copy_tree(node * & result, node * source)
{


}

//Step 9 - implement the destructor as a "wrapper"
//
//Implement the binary_tree destructor. Make this a
//wrapper function, calling the recursive delete_all function below
binary_tree::~binary_tree()
{


}

//Recursive delete all function
void binary_tree::delete_all(node * & root)
{



}


//Step 10 - implement the store constructor with arguments
//
//Store constructor with an argument
//Hint: Think about initialization lists
store::store(char * new_store_name, address & stores_location)
{



}

//Step 11 - imelment the store class' display_all
//
//Display all - think about what the job of this function should be:
void store::display_all() 
{


}
