//This class interface is a subset of Lab#1 on OOP. You will want to examine       
//the .h file to understand how these classes are put together. There are some     
//GAPS in the classes, as per the lab assignment, where you are supposed to fill   
//things in. This code WILL NOT compile as is without finishing up your part
//of the lab! But, at least you won't be starting from scratch!                    
                                                                                   
//What I wanted to show you with these classes is that there is much more to       
//OOP and classes than creating just setters and getters. In fact, you will notice 
//with my design that I never have "get" functions. If you have a "get" function   
//always ask youself why is it there? Why does another function need to get my     
//hidden data? Based on that answer, you can add the necessary functionality to    
//the class in general.                                                            
                                                                                   
//In this subset, there is an address class which keeps track of an individuals    
//address(street and zip for now). To make a full address class, you would want to 
//add a street number, city, and state. Then there is a name class.
