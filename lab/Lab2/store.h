/* THIS IS THE CLASS WHERE YOU WILL BE MAKING CHANGES FOR LAB #2 
   The node functions have all been implemented, so you can use them 
   as you get used to the concept of having a node be a class instead
   of a struct.

   Remember that a "node" IS A "hourly employee", so through the root 
   pointer you can always call all of the public functions within the 
   hourly_employee class and the rest of the hierarchy */
